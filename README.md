# Boots Review 

The Boots review site has the main goal of being a site where people can go to view reviews of different pairs of football boots that other people have owned. The aim is that this will be a site they can visit to assist them in making the decision of what pair of boots to purchase. 

A secondary aim of the site is that when these people have bought their pair of boots, they will be able to review their new pair of boots and assist others in making their decision.
