# Boots Review 

The Boots review site has the main goal of being a site where people can go to view reviews of different pairs of football boots that other people have owned. The aim is that this will be a site they can visit to assist them in making the decision of what pair of boots to purchase. 

A secondary aim of the site is that when these people have bought their pair of boots, they will be able to review their new pair of boots and assist others in making their decision.

## Design Choices
Generally, football boots tend to be quite sleek and stylish so I decided to try and keep this site the same way. The overall look and feel of the site is very soft touch with nice lines and angles. The colours are quite bright and bold with lots of orange and black and blue and off white. The touch of colour, I feel gives the site an extra bit of style.

### Fonts
There is little text on the landing page. For the fonts, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?standard-styles=). This is a really fantastic feature of [Google](https://google.com) which is great for getting any kind of font you want. The fonts I chose for my page are *Play* & *Roboto* with *sans-serif* as a backup font in the event that [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?standard-styles=) does not work. The reason I decided to use *Play* & *Roboto* is that I found them to be quite sleek fonts which would almost represent a pair of football boots. 

### Colours
In deciding the colour scheme for the site, I decided to go for a cool, almost retro mix between orange and blue mixed with black. There is often a lot of black with splashes of colour. The black tends to make the colour stand out and is a really good contrasting background for reading content. The same idea goes for the off white that is used throughout the site as well. 

I used the site [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to assist in generating a colour scheme for the site. This is a great site as it gives you the codes of the colours you want in any form you want ie. Hex code. 

![Colour Pallette](static/images/color-palette.png)

The colours I have chosen are: 
* Rich Black Fogra 39 - Hex (0B0909)
* White - Hex (FFFFFF)
* Platinum - Hex (ECEAEC)
* Aero - Hex (67B7E6)
* Persian Orange - Hex (E98D50)

### Icons 
I have gone to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons that I have used in the site. The icons, I feel just add a little bit extra to the site in terms of style and make it a bit more visually appealing which ultimately provides a better User Experience.

### Wireframes
When creating my wireframes, I first drew some rough sketches on paper but then decided that [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) would be the most suitable technology to use to assist with the design of the site. 

I created mock ups for my page to fit into the main device types - Desktop, Tablet and Mobile. The mock-ups for the devices can be found here: 
* [Mobile]()
* [Tablet] ()
* [Desktop] ()

### Data Schema
To carry out the functionality of the site, I needed to create three different collections of data. They are: 
1. Users 
3. Categories
4. Reviews
7. Makes
8. Star Ratings

The Users collection is made up of the following fields: 
| Field    | Data Type | Default |

| category          | string    | N/A     |
|boots_name         | string    | N/A     |
| make              | string    | N/A     |

The Makes collection is made up of the following fields:
| Field | Data Type | Default |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| id    | ObjectId  | N/A     |
| name  | string    | N/A     |

The Stars collection is made up of the following fields:

## Testing

### User Story Testing
1. #### User Registration
    1. #### Create a secure account with a username and password
    * #### Plan
    I planned to create the landing page with a button to for login and signup on the actual page as well as having nav items to these same pages so as to increase the likelyhood of the user seeing the link.
    The plan once the user gets to the registration page is to request that they create a username and secure password and click signup. I will discuss the form authentication for the patterns required in the username and password in the form authentication testing section.   
    * #### Implementation
    I did exactly as planned on this and created the landing page with the links found in Bootstrap buttons on the page and in the Bootstrap navbar as well so that the user would find it as easy as possible to get to these pages while also being able to see an attractive landing page.
    I created a separate page for the signup form to rest in and the set up the backend function to allow the user to add a record to the user collection in the database when they signup correctly.
    * #### Test
    To test the different scenarios of this part of the user story, I needed to test registering with a brand new username and an already existing username. I also tested the form validation to ensure the user data integrity and this is discussed in the form validation testing below.
    * #### Result
    The user registration worked exactly as expected and the user was not able to signup with an existing username and succesfully signed up with a username that didn't exist. When signup was successfull the user received a flash message to make them aware of same.
    
    This is a pass

    * #### Result

8. #### Profile:
    1. #### View 
    * #### Plan
    The plan is that when the user signs up, logs in or clicks on the profile tab in the navbar, that they will be able to view their profile page which should display they username, photo and bio (if added to profile) or if not already to the profile page, I plan on putting in place a default icon for the profile picture and a message in the place of the profile bio to let the user know that they can edit their profile and add the bio in it's place
    * #### Implementation
    To implement this, I created a profile page with the outlined elements above and linked the profile page where relevant. I put in place an if statement using Jinja syntax to check if the user collection has any data in the fields for the profile picture and bio and if they do, then to display the relevant data in the rendered page. If they do not have data in those fields, I put in place a default profile icon and bio message as mentioned above. Of course the functionality for the relevant features was created using the profile function in the backend. 

    * #### Test
    To test this, I logged in as a new user to first see if the expected default profile pic would be in place and also the default message in the place of the profile bio. I then logged in as an existing user who had some data in place i.e. profile pic and bio. 

    * #### Result
    I was able to see all of the features of the profile page as expected and all of the information was correct and displaying as expected.
    
    This is a pass

    2. #### Edit
    * #### Plan
    For the user to edit their profile page, I wanted to give them an edit button which sat directly underneath their profile picture and that made it really clear that they could edit their profile using good UX. As all of the other buttons in the site, this button would be made with Bootstrap and would have custom styling. The edit button would take the user to a new page where they would find the edit profile form. Once they fill in the form, they can click a submit button or they can cancel the edit profile action which would take them back to their profile page. The aim is for the user to have to input their password to be able to update their profile page. I also want to provide the user with confirmation that the profile has been successfully updated.

    * #### Implementation
    I created the button to edit the profile page with Bootstraps buttons and placed it under the profile picture. Once the user clicks this button, it redirects them to the edit profile page using Jinja and Python routing. I created the form in html and added the action and method to this so that it's a post method and made all of the input fields mandatory so that the user has to input the data which will make the site more rich and ultimately provide a better UX.

    * #### Test
    The test for this is to go into a users profile and click edit profile. It should take them to the edit profile page where they can fill in the form in it's entirity or cancel editing the profile. If they fill in a new password, this will become their new password or they can fill in their existing one to complete the form. 

    * #### Result
    I was able to carry out all of the forementioned actions without any errors. I got a flash message once I hit the submit button to say that I had successfully updated the profile page.
    This test was a success.

    3. #### Delete 
    * #### Plan
    The delete button is planned to be placed beside the edit button underneath the profile picture but I want it to be cloured in red to let the user know that it is not to be pressed without thinking first. Once the user clicks the delete button, I plan on a modal popping up for them as a form of defensive programming. The user will then warned in the modal and they would have to click another red delete button before the profile is deleted. 

    * #### Implementation
    To implement this feature and satisfy the user story, the delete button and modal was created using Bootstrap. The button targets the modal which triggers it to be brought up on screen. There is then another set of buttons in the modal and the delete button calls the delete function which is in Python to delete the user profile from the database and also delete that user's reviews. Once the deletion has occured, then the user is redirected to the homepage via the delete profile function in the backend.  

    * #### Test
    To test this, the user clicks the delete button, a modal should pop up for them as a form of defensive programming. The user will then be warned in the modal and they would have to click another red delete button before the profile is deleted. Once the claimant deletes the profile, they are redirected to the home page. Alternatively, if the user decides that they do not want to delete the page, they can click the close button to get out of the modal. 

    * #### Result
    This test was carried out on a couple of occassions and the result was as expected. The delete button was clicked, a modal popped up with a warning before deletion is completed. The close button was clicked to ensure that I could cancel the deletion of the profile page which worked as expected. The delete button was then clicked and the site was rediected to the home page and the login and signup buttons are displayed. 
    
    This test was a success.

### Lighthouse Testing

The Lighthouse tool, which can be found in Chrome Dev Tools is a really useful tool for testing the performance, accesibility and overall correctness of a page. All you have to do to use it is right click on a page, click inspect and click into the Lighthouse extension. Once there, all you do is generate a report for each page of the website. The report gives an overall score of how your webpage has performed in the test and it will give areas for improvement. This should be repeated for Mobile and Desktop. The reports for Simon's Piano can be found below:
