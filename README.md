# Boots Review 

The Boots review site has the main goal of being a site where people can go to view reviews of different pairs of football boots that other people have owned. The aim is that this will be a site they can visit to assist them in making the decision of what pair of boots to purchase. 

A secondary aim of the site is that when these people have bought their pair of boots, they will be able to review their new pair of boots and assist others in making their decision.

## Design Choices
Generally, football boots tend to be quite sleek and stylish so I decided to try and keep this site the same way. The overall look and feel of the site is very soft touch with nice lines and angles. The colours are quite simple with lots of black and white but with a bit of colour to give it that little bit of extra style.

### Fonts
There is very little text on the landing page so as not to distract the user and not to take the user's attention away from understanding what the overall aim of the site actually is. For the fonts, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?standard-styles=). This is a really fantastic feature of [Google](https://google.com) which is great for getting any kind of font you want. The fonts I chose for my page are *Play* & *Roboto* with *sans-serif* as a backup font in the event that [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?standard-styles=) does not work. The reason I decided to use *Play* & *Roboto* is that I found them to be quite sleek fonts which would almost represent a pair of football boots. 

### Colours
In deciding the colour scheme for the site, I decided to keep it nice and simple while at the same time trying to make it sleek and almost stealthy as this is the feel that is often hinted upon in tv ads for football boots. There is often a lot of black with splashes of colour. The black tends to make the colour stand out and is a really good contrasting background for reading content. The same idea goes for white. 

I used the site [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to assist in generating a colour scheme for the site. This is a great site as it gives you the codes of the colours you want in any form you want ie. Hex code.

The colours I have chosen are: 
* Rich Black Fogra 39 - Hex (0B0909)
* White - Hex (FFFFFF)
* Platinum - Hex (ECEAEC)
* Capri - Hex (21C2FD)
* Red RYB - Hex (FF1F0A)

### Icons 
I have gone to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons that I have used in the site. The icons, I feel just add a little bit extra to the site in terms of style and make it a bit more visually appealing which ultimately provides a better User Experience.

### Wireframes
When creating my wireframes, I first drew some rough sketches on paper but then decided that [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) would be the most suitable technology to use to assist with the design of the site. 

I created mock ups for my page to fit into the main device types - Desktop, Tablet and Mobile. The mock-ups for the devices can be found here: 
* [Mobile]()
* [Tablet] ()
* [Desktop] ()
